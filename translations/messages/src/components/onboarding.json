    "defaultMessage": "You can use Origin Messaging to chat with other users. Origin Messaging allows you to communicate with other users in a secure and decentralized way. Messages are private and, usually, can only be read by you or the recipient. In the case that either of you opens a dispute, messages can also be read by a third party arbitrator.\n\nGet started with messaging in two steps. First, you will use your Ethereum wallet to enable Origin Messaging. Then you will sign your public messaging key so that other users can find and chat with you. Using Origin Messaging is free and will not cost you any ETH or Origin Token."
